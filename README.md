Timeline
Week 1



Understand the project requirements.
Choose a topic and begin brainstorming ideas for the interactive learning module.




Conduct detailed research on the chosen topic.
Outline the structure of the learning module and decide on the content for each lesson.




Create wireframes or mock-ups for the module interface.
Select color schemes, fonts, and any graphics or media you plan to use.




Set up the project repository on GitHub.
Begin coding the HTML structure for the first lesson.




Share progress with peers for initial feedback.
Reflect on feedback and revise the plan as necessary.




Take a day to rest and reflect on the work completed.
Review the project timeline and adjust if needed.

Week 2



Write the content for all lessons and style with CSS.
Ensure the design is responsive and accessible.




Implement JavaScript interactivity for the lessons.
Test each interactive element for functionality.




Conduct a comprehensive peer review.
Collect feedback and make necessary revisions.




Test the entire module on different devices and browsers.
Begin writing the project documentation and reflective component.




Make final revisions based on testing.
Finalize documentation and ensure all parts of the project are complete.




Double-check all work against the submission checklist.
Submit the project with all required links and documentation.




A1: Select a topic that interests you and that you're passionate about. It should be something you are comfortable explaining and can break down into at least five interactive lessons.


A2: Debugging is a key part of the development process. Use resources like MDN Web Docs to understand the issue, and don’t hesitate to ask for help from peers or instructors. Remember to check your code incrementally to catch bugs early.


A3: Your outline should provide a clear roadmap of your module, including lesson titles, key objectives, and a brief description of the interactive elements you plan to incorporate.


A4: Aim to commit your changes frequently – after every significant update or daily. This not only helps track your progress but also serves as a backup of your work.


A5: Yes, you can use libraries or frameworks if you feel comfortable and if they enhance your learning module. However, ensure you still demonstrate a clear understanding of core HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts.


A6: Reach out to your instructor as soon as possible to discuss any challenges you're facing. It’s important to manage your time well, but there may be ways to adjust your plan to catch up.


A7: Your project will be evaluated based on the rubrics provided, which consider content coverage, engagement and interactivity, learning assessment, user experience, and the quality of your documentation and code.


A8: Approach peer feedback with an open mind. Look for common themes in the feedback you receive, and prioritize changes that will have the most significant impact on improving your module.


A9: There are no strict restrictions, but the design should be user-friendly and accessible. The aesthetics should support the content and functionality of your learning module.


A10: Test your module on different browsers and devices to ensure compatibility and responsiveness. Also, validate your HTML and CSS using W3C validation services.


A11: Your documentation should clearly articulate your design process, challenges faced, solutions, and the reasoning behind your decisions. It should be concise yet comprehensive enough for someone unfamiliar with your work to understand your process.


A12: Timely submission is part of the project’s learning outcomes. However, if you're facing extenuating circumstances, discuss them with your instructor to find a possible solution.
